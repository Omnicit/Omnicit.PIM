    # plus README.md and CHANGELOG.md at the root.
    #
    # docs/live-verification/ is where live tenant console output is pasted in on purpose, and it
    # is the folder this gate was written for. Today it holds the placeholder register (its
    # README.md) and nothing else; the checklists arrive with the first live-verified change.
    # docs/VERSIONING.md is the other tracked file under docs/. The internal planning and design
    # material under docs/superpowers/ is git-ignored and never tracked, so no rule here needs to
    # reach it.
    #
    # source/ and tests/ are in scope because the repository is public. source/ ships inside the
    # built module to every installed copy on the PowerShell Gallery, and tests/ is in the public
    # repository. Both are as unredactable after the fact as a checklist.
    #
    # README.md and CHANGELOG.md are in scope for every rule here, not only the Markdown one: they
    # are PUBLISHED text -- the repository's front page, and the release notes the Gallery shows --
    # and README carries tenant-map and filter examples with object ids in them. They are read
    # under the CODE-scope object-id rule (see PROSE SCOPE vs CODE SCOPE below).
    #
    # Every extension is scanned, not just .md. A binary file would be scanned as text too, which
    # for a leak gate errs toward RED -- the right direction. A top-level specs/ does not exist
    # today; it is in scope so that one created later is covered from its first commit instead of
    # silently skipped.
    #
    # KNOWN FALSE POSITIVE, deliberately not exempted: a Graph annotation such as the
    # 'members' odata.bind form matches the address pattern below. No tracked file in scope carries
    # one -- this comment deliberately names it WITHOUT its '@' for that reason, which is also the
    # fix if one is ever added. Do not add an exemption, and never widen the domain allowlist to
    # make this gate green.

    # GitHub reads a '<word>' written outside code as an HTML tag and renders nothing in its
    # place, so a redacted stand-in such as '<id>' silently vanishes from the page that is the

    # Markdown only, and it reaches two files at the root that no other check here does:
    # README.md, the repository's front page, and CHANGELOG.md, whose [Unreleased] section is
    # published as the release notes: the PowerShell Gallery shows them as plain text, and the
    # GitHub release body built from the same notes renders them as Markdown, where a tag
    # vanishes. The root files are also in the scope above, for the object-id, address and
    # credential rules; this pattern is the separate, Markdown-only list the tag check reads.

    # PROSE SCOPE vs CODE SCOPE -- why the object-id rule is not the same in both.
    #
    # Under docs/ and specs/ every GUID is PROSE. It got there by being pasted out of a console, so
    # the rule is absolute: it must be a 00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000000000NN placeholder.
    #
    # Under source/ and tests/ a GUID is a FIXTURE, typed on purpose, and in README.md and
    # CHANGELOG.md it is an EXAMPLE, written on purpose. Measured on 2026-10-06, before this file
    # was added, the four held 92 GUID sites between them: the all-zeros placeholders, a few
    # letter-repeat fixtures (aaaaaaaa-..., bbbbbbbb-..., cccccccc-...), the Microsoft Graph
    # resource application id, the v4-shaped values the register below pins, and one v4 group id in
    # README's tenant-map example, which this gate's first run replaced with a placeholder. Forcing
    # every fixture to the placeholder shape would buy nothing: none of them could ever have come
    # from a tenant.
    #
    # So the code-scope rule keys on the one structural property that separates a real identifier
    # from an invented one: a TENANT-GENERATED Entra ID object id, and an ARM subscription or
    # resource id, is a version-4 (random) UUID, and no hand-written fixture in this repository
    # needs to be. A v4-shaped GUID in source/, tests/, README.md or CHANGELOG.md is therefore
    # either a real identifier that must not ship, or a fixture typed to look like one, which is
    # indistinguishable from the first by inspection and just as bad. The placeholder range is not
    # v4, so placeholders pass here too.
    #
    # WHAT THIS RULE DOES NOT CATCH, stated rather than left to be discovered. Some well-known
    # Microsoft identifiers are deliberately NOT v4 -- the Microsoft Graph service principal's own
    # application id is a hand-assigned value in the all-zeros style -- and this check lets them
    # through. That is the correct direction: a non-random id is a published constant that is the
    # same in every tenant, not somebody's directory object. The residual gap is the mirror image:
    # a tenant identifier that somehow is not v4 would be missed here. Nothing generates such an id
    # today, and the rule is a shape heuristic rather than a proof -- redacting as you write, and
    # the register in docs/live-verification/README.md, remain the primary control.
    #
    # This is a rule about SHAPE, not a list of blessed values, and that is the point: it cannot be
    # satisfied by adding an entry to something. The four exceptions below are the whole of the
    # list, they are pinned, and each one is a published Microsoft constant or the module's own
    # identity -- never a tenant object.

    # this module, and the other three are published by Microsoft and identical in every tenant on
    # earth.

    # TENANT DOMAINS -- two labels are allowed, and the list does not grow to make this gate green.
    #
    # Every tenant has an initial domain: a LABEL in front of .onmicrosoft.com, .onmicrosoft.us in
    # the US Government clouds, or .onmschina.cn under 21Vianet. The label names exactly one
    # tenant, so it identifies a customer as surely as the tenant id does, and it arrives in exactly
    # the places this gate watches: sign-in output, user principal names, Graph request paths. None
    # of the other rules here reads it. It is no GUID, and the email rule sees it only behind a
    # literal '@' -- not as a bare domain, not URL-encoded in a request path, not escaped in a
    # regular expression.
    #
    # So every line is NORMALIZED before it is matched: '%40' becomes '@' (a user principal name
    # in a URL-encoded path), and a dot behind one or more backslashes becomes a plain dot (a
    # domain written as a regular expression in a test, or that expression escaped once more, as
    # it is inside JSON). Each is a form a test or a request path can carry, and without the
    # normalization each would slip through. A bare mention of the suffix, with no label in front
    # of it, names no tenant and never matches.
    #
    # Every entry below is a fictional documentation tenant. A real label is never added here to
    # make this gate green: the fix is to replace it with one of these. The It named 'Should hold
    # no stale entry in the tenant-domain allowlist' fails on an entry that has left the tree, the

    #
    # docs/live-verification/README.md allocates every placeholder used outside the checklists --
    # the all-zeros object ids and the personN addresses -- one row per slot, and names the next
    # free one in a sentence. A register nothing reads drifts: in Omnicit.EntraRBAC, before its
    # gate read it, the sentence named a slot the table had already given away. The register's
    # whole purpose is to stop two objects sharing one placeholder, so a register that disagrees
    # with itself is the defect it exists to prevent, waiting to happen.
    #
    # The gate reads it (Get-DocHygienePlaceholderRegister), fails on a register that contradicts
    # itself (Get-DocHygieneRegisterFinding), and fails on a placeholder used in source/, tests/,
    # README.md or CHANGELOG.md that the register does not show as taken. What it still cannot
    # check is whether a slot's description means what the last person thought it meant; the
    # unique description per row is that human check.
    #
    # The sample below exercises every shape the reader accepts -- ranges, single ids, lettered
    # tails, outliers, a reserved address -- and is the reader's known answer. A row after the
    # section's end is there on purpose: the reader must stop at the next heading.
    #
    # Which ids a row covers: a RANGE row covers only tails made of three decimal digits, within
    # its bounds read as decimal numbers, and a row that names ONE placeholder covers exactly its
    # own tail, letters included. That is how '...0aa' and '...abc' are registered, and why a tail
    # such as '...00a' is not covered by '...000' - '...045'. The register's checks against itself
    # still order ids as HEX, which is where '...0aa' and '...abc' take their place among the others.

## The placeholder register

Prose before the tables is read too, and holds nothing the reader takes.

| Placeholder | Slot (generic) | Status |
|---|---|---|
| `...000` - `...045` | the per-file numbering and the any-id stand-in | taken, under the per-file rule |
| `...046` | a subscription id in the worked example | taken |
| `...047` | a principal id in the worked example | taken |
| `...066` and up | -- | **FREE. Allocate from here.** |
| `...099` | a deliberately non-existent object id | taken |
| `...0aa` | an assignment target principal id | taken |
| `...abc` | an administrative unit id | taken |

Addresses follow the same global rule:

| Placeholder | Slot (generic) | Status |
|---|---|---|
| `person1` - `person13`, `person15` - `person45` | reviewers, requestors and members | taken |
| `person14` | -- | allocated and never used; left reserved, do not reuse |
| `person46` and up | -- | **FREE. Allocate from here.** |

`...0aa`, `...abc` and `...099` sit outside the counting sequence for historical reasons and are
listed so they are not handed out twice. Allocate new object ids from `...066` and new addresses
from `person46`, and add a row here in the same commit that uses them.

## The next section

| `...070` | a row after the register, which the reader must not take | taken |

    # machine and GREEN in CI, and a gate that is red only locally gets switched off rather than

            .SYNOPSIS
                Returns 'path:line' for every match of Pattern that IsAllowed rejects.

            .DESCRIPTION
                The matched VALUE is never returned and never rendered. This gate exists to keep
                tenant identifiers out of logs, and a failure message that quoted its own hit would
                copy that identifier into every CI run that went red -- turning the guard into the
                leak it was added to close.

                IsAllowed is called with the matched value AND the file entry it came from, so a
                check can apply one rule to prose under docs/ and another to code under source/.

                AcrossLineBreak adds a second pass for a value that console output WRAPPED: a
                formatted table breaks a long cell at the column edge and indents the rest, so one
                identifier lands on two lines and neither line alone matches. That pass reads the
                file as one string with every line break, and the whitespace on both sides of it,
                removed. It reports only a match that crosses a line boundary, at the line the match
                starts on; a match inside one line is the first pass's to report, so no location
                is counted twice.

        <#
            .SYNOPSIS
                Returns a Markdown file's lines with fenced blocks and code spans blanked out.

            .DESCRIPTION
                Ported unchanged from Omnicit.EntraRBAC's gate. The algorithm is exactly the one in
                Test-MdAngleBrackets.py, the maintainer's checker for the live-verification notes
                kept outside this repository, and the two must agree hit for hit on the same tree.
                It is close to CommonMark but not the same, and where they differ the script is
                what this follows:

                - A line that opens with optional whitespace and then three or more backticks or
                  tildes opens a fenced block. The block runs to the next such line of the same
                  character whose run is at least as long, or to the end of the file. The whole
                  block is skipped, both fence lines included.
                - The remaining lines are grouped into paragraphs at blank lines and at fences.
                - Within a paragraph, a run of N backticks opens a code span that the next run of
                  exactly N closes, across a line break too. A candidate closer FOLLOWED by another
                  backtick is skipped; only the character after it is checked. A run with no
                  closer is literal text.
                - A code span is replaced by spaces with its line breaks kept, so every character
                  left keeps its line and column.

                KNOWN FALSE NEGATIVE, deliberately not handled, shared with Test-MdAngleBrackets.py:
                CommonMark lets an open tag's attributes cross one line break, so a long stand-in
                broken by the 100-column wrap -- '<management groups: the' ending one line and
                'listing failed>' starting the next -- is hidden by GitHub but matched by neither
                scanner, since the tag pattern stops at a line break. Zero such cases are in scope
                today. Keep a redacted stand-in on one line; do not change the pattern to reach
                across a break.

                Lines holds the masked text, one entry per input line, with skipped lines empty.
                CodeSpanCount is the number of code spans removed outside fenced blocks; the check
                uses it to prove that it reached any prose at all.

        <#
            .SYNOPSIS
                Returns the label of every tenant domain in Line, after normalization.

            .DESCRIPTION
                Before matching, '%40' is read as '@' and a dot behind one or more backslashes as a
                plain dot, so a user principal name in a URL-encoded path and a domain written as a
                regular expression, escaped once or twice, are read the way a tenant would read
                them. The label is the run of letters, digits and hyphens in front of one of the
                three suffixes, the commercial and US Government onmicrosoft ones and the 21Vianet
                onmschina one. A bare suffix with no label in front of it names no tenant and
                yields nothing.

                The pattern cannot match across a line break, so Line may also be a whole file
                joined with line feeds: a joined text with no label has none in any of its lines.

            .DESCRIPTION
                Each file is first read as ONE string, and only a file holding at least one tenant
                domain is read again line by line. That first pass is exact, not a heuristic -- see
                Get-DocHygieneTenantDomainLabel -- and it spares a per-line call on the many
                thousands of lines in scope that carry no domain at all.

                The Label is returned so a caller can test it against the allowlist. A caller that
                reports a hit renders the Location only, never the Label: the label IS the
                tenant's name.

                Reads the placeholder register out of the lines of docs/live-verification/README.md.

            .DESCRIPTION
                The register runs from the line '## The placeholder register' to the next line
                that starts with '## '. Nothing outside it is read.

                Every table row whose first cell holds a backticked id token (three dots and three
                hex characters) or address token ('person' and a number) becomes one Row:

                - Table: Id or Address, from the kind of the first token in the cell.
                - Intervals: one [Start, End] pair per comma-separated part of the first cell -- a
                  single token, an 'A - B' range, or 'A and up', whose End is [int]::MaxValue. An
                  id is its three characters read as HEX; an address is its number.
                - Unreadable: true when any part of the first cell is none of those three shapes,
                  when the cell mixes ids and addresses, when a range ends before it starts, or when
                  the row has fewer than three cells. Such a row is REPORTED, never skipped: a
                  reader that dropped a row it could not parse would quietly stop checking it.
                - Slot: the second cell, trimmed.
                - Status: Free when the third cell says FREE, Taken when it starts with 'taken',
                  otherwise Reserved.
                - Line: the 1-based line number in Line.

                The prose is read a paragraph at a time, with each paragraph's lines joined, so a
                sentence that wraps is still one sentence. AllocateId and AllocateAddress come from
                the first sentence of the form 'Allocate new object ids from (id) and new addresses
                from (address)', and AllocateLine is the line it starts on; all three are $null when
                no such sentence exists. Outliers are the ids named in the sentence that says they
                sit 'outside the counting sequence', and HeadingLine is the line of the heading
                itself, or $null when the section is missing.

            .SYNOPSIS
                Returns one 'line: what' string per defect in a register read by
                Get-DocHygienePlaceholderRegister.

            .DESCRIPTION
                A register is defective when:

                - a row's placeholder cell cannot be read (such a row takes part in no other check);
                - two taken or reserved intervals of the same table overlap;
                - two rows that are not FREE share a slot description, compared trimmed, with each
                  run of whitespace read as one space, and ignoring case, where '--' is no
                  description and is never compared;
                - a table has not exactly one FREE row;
                - the Allocate sentence names an id or an address other than the start of its
                  table's FREE row, or is missing;
                - a taken or reserved id at or above the Id table's FREE start is not one of the
                  outliers, or a taken or reserved address is at or above the Address table's.

                The last two need exactly one FREE row to compare against; a table without one is
                reported by the check before them instead. A finding names placeholder tokens
                such as '...066' and 'person46', which identify a slot in this register and nothing
                in any tenant, and never quotes a slot description.

            .SYNOPSIS
                Returns 'path:line' for every placeholder in File that Register does not show as taken.

            .DESCRIPTION
                An all-zeros object id is a register placeholder when the last twelve hex digits
                start with nine zeros; its slot is the last three, and a TAKEN row of the Id table
                must cover it. A row that names one placeholder covers exactly its own tail, letters
                included. A range row covers only a tail made of three decimal digits, within its
                bounds read as decimal numbers, so a tail with a letter is never covered by a range
                even where its hex value falls inside it. Any other tail is reported too: it has
                the placeholder's shape without being one the register can hand out. A
                personN@example.com address must fall in a TAKEN interval of the Address table.

                Reserved and FREE are both reported. A reserved slot was set aside so that it is
                never used, and a FREE one used without a row is exactly the state the next person
                allocates over. Unreadable rows grant nothing.

                The matched value is never returned, only its location.

        #
        # An object id is a NAME. A credential is ACCESS. Redacting an id after the fact closes the
        # leak; redacting a credential after the fact does not -- the value was already committed,
        # already pushed, and already in every clone and every CI cache that fetched the branch.
        # A credential that reaches a tracked file is ROTATED, never merely redacted, and the
        # README says so. This gate exists to catch the paste before it becomes a rotation.
        #
        # Live console output is exactly where credentials arrive by accident: an app registration's
        # client secret pasted into a setup section so the run can be repeated, and -- the case that
        # motivated this check -- an ErrorRecord whose TargetObject is the raw HttpRequestMessage,
        # which renders 'Authorization: Bearer <jwt>' in full when a failed Graph read is
        # transcribed. Neither of the two checks above would see either one: a JWT holds no GUID in
        # the shape they match, and no email address.
        #
        # UNDER tests/ THE SAME SHAPE CAN BE REQUIRED, not accidental. A test that proves the module
        # keeps a bearer token out of an error record or an output stream -- the replacement for the
        # $Error.Remove idiom that CLAUDE.md plans is one -- has to hand the module something
        # token-shaped, so a rule of 'no token shape here' would forbid exactly the security tests
        # that matter most. The rule instead is that a credential-shaped literal must SAY IT IS NOT
        # ONE, in the value itself -- see the marker below. A real token pasted while debugging
        # cannot satisfy that by accident, and a fixture satisfies it by being written down honestly.
