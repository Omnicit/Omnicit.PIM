    <#
    .SYNOPSIS
    Returns a fingerprint of a Microsoft Graph PowerShell SDK session, or $null when there is none.

    .DESCRIPTION
    The Microsoft Graph PowerShell SDK keeps one session per process, and Invoke-OPIMGraphRequest
    sends every Graph call under it with no token of its own. Initialize-OPIMAuth records this
    fingerprint straight after its own Connect-MgGraph, and Get-OPIMGraphSessionState compares it
    with the session the process holds before the module trusts its cached token or sends a Graph
    call.

    It is built from eight properties of the context Get-MgContext returns: AuthType,
    TokenCredentialType, ClientId, TenantId, Account, AppName, Environment and Scopes (sorted
    ordinally). For a Connect-MgGraph -AccessToken session, the one this module makes, the SDK sets
    AuthType and TokenCredentialType to UserProvidedAccessToken and fills ClientId, TenantId,
    Account, AppName and Scopes from the token's appid, tid, upn, app_displayname and scp or roles
    claims. Any other Connect-MgGraph -- a certificate, a client secret, a managed identity, an
    interactive sign-in, or a token for another application, tenant or user -- therefore gives a
    different fingerprint. Two sessions with equal values give an equal fingerprint whatever object
    carries them.

    It never reads the context's ClientSecret or Certificate, never keeps the context object, and
    never holds a token: the SDK keeps the token in its own token cache, not on the context. It does
    hold the session's tenant id and user principal name, so it is never written to any stream.

    .PARAMETER Context
    A context as Get-MgContext returns it; $null means there is no session. When omitted,
    Get-MgContext is called once.

    .EXAMPLE
    $Fingerprint = Get-OPIMGraphSessionFingerprint

    Fingerprints the Graph SDK session the process holds now, or returns $null when there is none.

    .OUTPUTS
    [string] A compact JSON object, or $null.

        return $null
    }

    # Sorted ordinally, so the same grant in another order is the same session. [string[]] over an
    # empty pipeline is an empty array, so a context with no scopes still fingerprints.

    # JSON, not a joined string: a value holding the separator can never make two sessions compare
    # equal. Every value is read by name -- never by enumerating the context, which would read its
    # ClientSecret and Certificate too.
