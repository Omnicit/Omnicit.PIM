function Remove-OPIMErrorRecord {
    <#
    .SYNOPSIS
    Strips the bearer token off a swallowed error record and removes the record from the caller's
    $global:Error list.

    .DESCRIPTION
    Does two things, in this order, and BOTH are load-bearing.

    1. SCRUB. The raw Graph SDK error record points, through .TargetObject and through the
    exception chain, at the very System.Net.Http.HttpRequestMessage the failing call built -- and
    that message carries "Authorization: Bearer <token>" in plain text. This helper clears the
    Authorization header ON that object. Because the request message is a single instance shared by
    every reference to it, clearing the header there removes the token RETROACTIVELY from every
    copy of the record that already escaped: the caller's -ErrorVariable collection, $global:Error,
    and any record a nested frame republished. Nothing else can achieve that. -ErrorVariable is
    populated by the ENGINE from the error stream, captures records raised inside nested calls even
    when an inner catch swallowed them, and is a separate collection this module cannot edit, so
    removing a list entry (step 2) never touches those copies; mutating the shared object does.

    2. REMOVE. Replaces the module-wide bearer-hygiene idiom that discarded the result of calling
    the ArrayList .Remove() method with $PSItem against the automatic $Error variable, which never
    actually worked from module scope. Inside module code, the automatic $Error variable resolves to
    the module's own private list -- the record a catch block just swallowed is never in it. Even
    against $global:Error (the caller's real list, and the one that can genuinely carry a
    bearer-token-bearing HttpRequestMessage in TargetObject), the ErrorRecord instance bound to
    $PSItem inside a catch block is a DIFFERENT object than the one PowerShell appended to
    $global:Error, so a reference-equality Remove($PSItem) silently no-ops. The one part of the
    record that IS reference-stable across that boundary is its Exception object. This helper scans
    $global:Error for the first entry whose .Exception is reference-identical (never message-equal --
    two unrelated failures can share the same text, and removing the wrong record would be worse than
    removing none) to the supplied record's .Exception, and removes only that entry.

    Call this as the first statement in a catch block on a transport path, exactly where the old
    $Error-based removal line used to be. Emits nothing to the pipeline (so a stray return value can
    never corrupt a cmdlet's own output), never throws, and makes no network call, since it runs on
    the failure path where a throw here would mask the original error being handled.

    .PARAMETER Record
    The ErrorRecord caught in a catch block (normally $PSItem). Its .TargetObject and exception
    chain -- following .InnerException AND an AggregateException's .InnerExceptions, since the
    Graph SDK's retry path throws the latter and its real transport failure is not always at index
    0 -- are searched for an HttpRequestMessage (directly, as the .RequestMessage of an
    HttpResponseMessage, or one hop further behind a wrapper object carrying a Request,
    RequestMessage or Response member) whose Authorization header is cleared, and its matching entry in
    $global:Error -- found by Exception reference identity, not ErrorRecord object identity -- is
    removed. Safe to pass $null; the helper then does nothing. A record whose Exception is $null is
    still scrubbed, but nothing is removed from $global:Error, since Exception identity is the only
    key that can find the entry.

    .EXAMPLE
    try {
        Invoke-MgGraphRequest @InvokeParams
    } catch {
        Remove-OPIMErrorRecord -Record $PSItem
        throw Convert-GraphHttpException $PSItem
    }

    Clears "Authorization: Bearer <token>" off the HttpRequestMessage the record points at -- which
    also disarms every copy of that record already sitting in the caller's -ErrorVariable -- and
    strips the record from the caller's $global:Error, before re-throwing a sanitized exception.
