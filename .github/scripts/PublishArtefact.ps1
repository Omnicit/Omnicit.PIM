    .SYNOPSIS
        Records the module build that the test matrix proved, and later verifies a downloaded copy
        of it file by file.

    .DESCRIPTION
        The publish job must ship the bytes the three required checks tested, and nothing else.
        Both halves of that proof live in this one file so they cannot drift apart: a recorder and
        a verifier that enumerated or hashed differently would fail on honest artefacts and agree
        on tampered ones.

        -Record runs on the ubuntu-latest leg of build-and-test, after its Test step. It writes
        publish-meta.json beside the built module, holding the commit, the version GitVersion
        computed, the version and prerelease the built manifest actually carries, and a SHA-256 for
        every file in the version folder.

        -Verify runs in the package job and again in the publish job, after the artefact is
        downloaded. It recomputes all of it, throws on the first disagreement, and returns the full
        path of the version folder it proved. That path is the one Publish-PSResource is given.

        -Path is, in both modes, the directory that CONTAINS module/<name>/<version>. That is
        output/ in the build job and the download directory downstream, because
        actions/upload-artifact roots an artefact at the least common ancestor of the paths it is
        given -- output/ for the module folder plus publish-meta.json. Keeping those two shapes
        equal is what lets one script read both.

        WHICH VERSION IS PUBLISHED. Publish-PSResource publishes the version in the MANIFEST, not
        the NuGetVersionV2 GitVersion computed, and the two are not always the same string. A
        PowerShell prerelease label must be alphanumeric, so Sampler keeps only the first
        hyphen-delimited segment of it: measured on 2026-09-22, GitVersion computed
        1.0.1-ci-publish-on-me0001 on a branch named ci/publish-on-merge while the manifest was
        stamped 1.0.1 with prerelease 'ci'. On main and on a v tag the two agree exactly
        (1.0.1-preview0001 stamps 1.0.1 plus 'preview0001', measured the same day). The downstream
        jobs therefore take the version to publish, to confirm and to tag from the MANIFEST, and
        this script asserts only what holds everywhere: that the manifest's ModuleVersion is the
        numeric part of NuGetVersionV2.

    .PARAMETER Record
        Write publish-meta.json for the build under -Path.

    .PARAMETER Verify
        Verify the build under -Path against the publish-meta.json sitting beside it.

    .PARAMETER Path
        The directory that contains module/<name>/<version>, and, in -Verify mode, publish-meta.json.

    .PARAMETER Sha
        The commit the build came from. Recorded in -Record mode; required to match in -Verify mode.

    .PARAMETER ModuleVersion
        NuGetVersionV2 as GitVersion computed it and the build job exported it. -Record only.

    .EXAMPLE
        ./.github/scripts/PublishArtefact.ps1 -Record -Path 'output' -Sha $env:GITHUB_SHA -ModuleVersion $env:ModuleVersion

    .EXAMPLE
        $ModulePath = ./.github/scripts/PublishArtefact.ps1 -Verify -Path 'artefact' -Sha $env:GITHUB_SHA
